Dject for VS Code is a suite of snippets to support quick, pain-free integration of the Dject dependency injection system. While in a Javascript, Vue, React, or Typescript file, type "dject" and select the snippet you want to use. It's just that simple.

Snippets support node and client-side development as well as special cases for Vue single-file components. Everything is baked and ready for immediate use, no fuss, no muss.
